# [net] Section: Global Training and Data Parameters
# ---------------------------------------------------
# batch=1              - Number of samples processed in one batch.
# subdivisions=1       - Number of mini-batches per batch (mini_batch = batch/subdivisions).
# inputs=256           - Dimensionality for non-image data (e.g., letters, prices).
# momentum=0.9         - Momentum for the optimizer (controls contribution of past gradients).
# decay=0.001          - Weight decay for regularization.
# max_batches=2000     - Maximum number of training iterations.
# time_steps=1         - For sequential data, number of time steps to process per iteration.
# learning_rate=0.1    - Initial learning rate.
# policy=steps         - Learning rate scheduling policy.
# steps=1000,1500      - Iterations at which to change the learning rate.
# scales=.1,.1         - Multiplicative factors for learning rate at each step.

# [cost] Section: Custom Arithmetic Loss Function
# -------------------------------------------------
# This custom cost layer (type "arith") is designed to compute losses based on 
# arithmetic operations on big numbers. It supports:
#   - addition
#   - subtraction
#   - multiplication
#   - division
# with high precision.
#
# precision=19      - Number of decimal places for float arithmetic.
# big_number=1      - Enables support for operations on very large numbers (e.g., 200-digit numbers).
# operations=...    - Comma-separated list of arithmetic operations to include in the loss.
